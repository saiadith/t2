# üöÄ Deployment Guide: E-commerce Analytics System

This guide will help you deploy your e-commerce analytics system on free hosting platforms.

## üéØ **Recommended Platform: Railway**

Railway is the best choice for your project because it supports:
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL databases
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connections
- ‚úÖ Docker containers
- ‚úÖ Free tier with $5/month credit
- ‚úÖ Easy GitHub integration

## üìã **Prerequisites**

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code must be in a GitHub repository
2. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **PostgreSQL Database** - We'll set this up on Railway

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Deployment**

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. **Verify these files are in your repository**:
- `Dockerfile.railway`
- `deploy_railway.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- All your application code

### Step 2: Set Up Railway

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign in
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Choose your repository**
5. **Select the main branch**

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. **In your Railway project, click "New"**
2. **Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"**
3. **Wait for the database to be created**
4. **Copy the database connection details**

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=your-postgres-host.railway.app
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=railway
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASS=your-postgres-password

# Application Configuration
PORT=8501
```

### Step 5: Deploy Your Application

1. **Go back to your main service**
2. **Click "Deploy"**
3. **Railway will build and deploy your application**
4. **Wait for deployment to complete**

### Step 6: Access Your Application

1. **Click on your deployed service**
2. **Copy the generated URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
3. **Open the URL in your browser**
4. **Your dashboard should be live!**

- Check if your app is using the correct port
- Verify WebSocket URL in your code

#### 3. Build Failures
**Solution:**
- Check `requirements.txt` for missing dependencies
- Verify Dockerfile syntax
- Check Railway build logs

#### 4. Application Not Starting
**Solution:**
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify `deploy_railway.py` is executable
- Ensure all required files are present

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

railway status

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Connect to database
railway connect
```

## üìä **Monitoring Your Deployment**

### Railway Dashboard
- **Real-time logs** - Monitor application output
- **Metrics** - CPU, memory, network usage
- **Deployments** - Track deployment history
- **Environment variables** - Manage configuration

### Health Checks
Your application includes health checks:
- Database connectivity
- WebSocket server status
- Event simulator status
- Streamlit dashboard availability

## üîí **Security Considerations**

### Production Deployment
1. **Change default passwords**
2. **Use environment variables for secrets**
3. **Enable SSL/TLS**
4. **Set up proper firewall rules**

### Data Protection
1. **Regular backups** of PostgreSQL data
2. **Encrypt sensitive data**
3. **Implement proper access controls**
